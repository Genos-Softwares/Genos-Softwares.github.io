Investing in a new Point of Sale (POS) system can seem daunting, 
but the return on investment (ROI) can be substantial. 

Let's look at a real-world example of how upgrading to a modern POS system transformed one restaurant's operations and bottom line in India.

## Meet Neeraj Sharma and Hot N' Fast

Neeraj Sharma is the owner of Hot N' Fast, a popular quick-service restaurant in Gurugram, Haryana serving burgers, pizzas, rolls, and beverages. Before upgrading their POS, Hot N' Fast faced several challenges:

- Long online orders and queues during peak hours, especially during college lunch breaks
- Frequent order mix-ups during the busy dinner rush
- Difficulty managing inventory for various menu items
- Limited insight into sales data across different food categories

## The Upgrade

Neeraj decided to invest in a modern POS system with the following features:

- Self-service kiosks for faster ordering
- Kitchen display system
- Integrated inventory management
- Comprehensive analytics

The initial investment was ₹45,000 for hardware and software.

## The Results

After six months of using the new POS system, Hot N' Fast saw significant improvements:

### 1. Increased Customer Throughput

- Before: Serving an average of 200 customers per day
- After: Serving an average of 275 customers per day
- Result: 37.5% increase in daily customers served

### 2. Reduced Order Errors

- Before: 7% of orders had errors
- After: Less than 1.5% of orders had errors
- Result: Improved customer satisfaction and reduced food waste

### 3. Optimized Inventory

- Before: 8% of ingredients wasted weekly
- After: Less than 3% of ingredients wasted
- Result: Approximately ₹20,000 saved per month

### 4. Increased Average Check Size

- Before: ₹250 per order
- After: ₹300 per order (due to upselling prompts and combo suggestions)
- Result: 20% increase in average revenue per order

### 5. Labor Cost Savings

- Before: 25% of revenue spent on labor
- After: 22% of revenue spent on labor (due to improved efficiency)
- Result: 3% reduction in labor costs

## The Bottom Line

In the first year after upgrading their POS system, Hot N' Fast saw:

- Revenue increase: ₹42,12,500 (factoring in more customers served and higher check averages)
- Cost savings: ₹7,80,000 (from reduced food waste and labor costs)
- Total benefit: ₹18,92,000

Subtracting the initial investment of ₹45,000, the net benefit was ₹18,92,000.



Hot N' Fast saw an impressive 42% profit growth in just the first year after upgrading their POS system.

While every restaurant's results will vary, this case study demonstrates the potential for significant returns 
when investing in a modern POS system. 

From increased efficiency to better decision-making capabilities, the right POS can transform your business.

Neeraj Sharma of Hot N' Fast says, "Upgrading our POS system was one of the best business decisions I've made.
