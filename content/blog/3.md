Running a successful cafe is about more than just serving great coffee. 
It's about smart business management. 
An efficient Point of Sale (POS) system can be your secret weapon in maximizing profits. Here's how:

## Track Your Best Sellers

A good POS system shows you which items are flying off the menu and which ones aren't performing well. 

Use this data to:
